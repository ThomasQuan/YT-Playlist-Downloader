This project basically is my approach to how I want to manage my Youtube music playlist and thumbnail,
because of how popular and mainstream of listening to Youtube while coding or anything at all.
Most of these command can be found on YT-dl, but I like to learn a bit from them and try myself out with 
YT-dl Python because there isn't seem to be a lot of instruction out there for Python.

COMMAND:
    Download full : python run.py download video/playlist 
    Download portion or section : python run.py download playlist [1:5] | [1,2,5,7]
    Restore playlist or download history: python run.py restore playlist.csv

How it will work:
    A youtube video or playlist will be inserted into the cmd and it will be downloaded base on the 
    user preferences. After download, a CSV file will contain all the playlist/video important info
    such as Title, thumbnail, id , url ...etc 
    
    *Features
        - Script will download an mp3 version of the video ✔
        - Script will download an mp3 version of the playlist ✔
        - Script will download an mp3 version of a selected number in the playlist  ✔
        - Script will get the title and URL of the video and append them into a text file ✔
        - Script will get the title, URL, thumbnail of the playlist videos and append them into a text file ✔ 
        - Script will help user delete Deleted video (will figure it out later on)
        - Script will download the latest videos based on previous latest downloaded video index ✔
          So everytime i need to update my library i can just run the script to get the latest
          Ex: new playlist on Youtube have 703 video and our database one have 700
                so we substract that 703-700 = 3 new entries found base on the latest
                    we use that to set the playlistend = 3 and playliststart to 1 

INSTALLATION:
    - pip install youtube-dl
    - ffmpeg ( URL : https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
