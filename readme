This project is aim to help me be more lazier with my music choice and prepare for the great DMCA

How it will work:
    A youtube video or playlist will be inserted into the cmd and it will be downloaded base on the 
    user preferences. After download, a CSV file will contain all the playlist/video important info
    such as Title, thumbnail, id , url ...etc 
    
    *Features
        - Script will download an mp3 version of the video ✔
        - Script will download an mp3 version of the playlist ✔
        - Script will download an mp3 version of a selected number in the playlist  ✔
        - Script will get the title and URL of the video and append them into a text file ✔
        - Script will get the title, URL, thumbnail of the playlist videos and append them into a text file ✔ 
        - Script will help user delete Deleted video(will work on it last)
        - Script will download the latest videos based on previous latest downloaded video index ✔
          So everytime i need to update my library i can just run the script to get the latest
          Ex: new playlist on Youtube have 703 video and our database one have 700
                so we substract that 703-700 = 3 new entries found base on the latest
                    we use that to set the playlistend = 3 and playliststart to 1 
        - More function to think of later on...
